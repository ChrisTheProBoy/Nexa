Indentation: Everything indented under the function definition is the code that will be executed when the function is called.\n\n4. `pass`: The `pass` statement in Python is a placeholder and does nothing. It's often used as a temporary placeholder when the function body will be filled in later. In this case, it seems the function body has not been filled out yet, so we don't have specific steps to explain.\n\n5. `return`: The `return` statement is used to end a function and specify a value to be sent back to the place where the function was called. Again, since the function body is empty, there's no return value specified here.\n\nIn summary, this code defines an incomplete function named \"step_by_step\" that takes one argument, `x`.

{"role": "nexa", "content": "Chris, here's some more information about struct Node* next in C programming. When traversing a linked list, you access each node by following the next pointer from one node to the next. To start the traversal, you assign the first node's address to a variable of type `struct Node*`. For example:\n\n```c\nstruct Node* currentNode = head; // head is the address of the first node\n```\n\nThen, to move to the next node, you can use the following line:\n\n```c\ncurrentNode = currentNode->next;\n```\n\nThis will update `currentNode` with the address of the next node in the list. Keep traversing until the next pointer points to NULL, which indicates the end of the list."}
