This allows for efficient traversal in both directions and makes operations like insertion, deletion, and reversing the list easier compared to singly linked lists. Here's how we can represent nodes for a doubly linked list:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, data=None):\n        self.data = data\n        self.next = None\n        self.prev = None\n\n# Creating nodes\nnode1 = Node(1)\nnode2 = Node(2)\nnode3 = Node(3)\n\n# Linking the nodes together (setting the 'next' and 'prev' pointers)\nnode1.prev = None\nnode1.next = node2\nnode2.prev = node1\nnode2.next = node3\nnode3.prev = node2\n```\n\nIn this example, `node1` points to `node2`, and `node2` points to `node3`. Similarly, `node2` points back to `node1` and `node3` points back to `node2`. By following these pointers, we can traverse through the doubly linked list in both directions.\n\nInserting a new node involves creating a new node, setting its `prev` and `next` pointers accordingly, and adjusting the `prev` and `next` pointers of the surrounding nodes. Deleting a node is similar but requires updating the surrounding nodes' `prev` and `next` pointers to bypass the deleted node.\n\nDisplaying a doubly linked list can be done by iterating through the list starting from either end (beginning or end) and printing each node's data as we traverse. Here's an example of displaying a doubly linked list in Python:\n\n```python\ndef display(head):\n    current = head\n    while current is not None:\n        print(current.data, end=\" <-> \")\n        current = current.next\n    print(\"None\")\n```",

Here's a basic example of a linked list in C programming:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\ntypedef struct Node {\n    int data;\n    struct Node* next;\n} Node;\n\nNode* createNode(int data) {\n    Node* newNode = (Node*) malloc(sizeof(Node));\n    if (!newNode) return NULL;\n    newNode->data = data;\n    newNode->next = NULL;\n    return newNode;\n}\n\nvoid insertAtBeginning(Node** head, int data) {\n    Node* newNode = createNode(data);\n    if (*head == NULL) {\n        *head = newNode;\n    } else {\n        newNode->next = *head;\n        *head = newNode;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid printList(Node* head) {\n    Node* current = head;\n    while (current != NULL) {\n        printf(\"%d \", current->data);\n        current = current->next;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    Node* head = NULL;\n    insertAtBeginning(&head, 5);\n    insertAtBeginning(&head, 3);\n    printList(head);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a linked list structure and functions to create a new node, insert it at the beginning of the list, and print the entire list. The `main` function creates a list with nodes containing the numbers 3 and 5 in that order.",
